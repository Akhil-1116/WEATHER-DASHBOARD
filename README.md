#DESCRIPTION

I have completed the task of developing a responsive weather application using React. The app fetches and displays real-time weather data based on user input by integrating with a weather API.

Key Features:
User Input: A search bar allows users to enter a city name to get weather details.
API Integration: The app fetches real-time weather data from an external API.
Dynamic Display: It shows temperature, weather conditions, humidity, and other relevant information.
Responsive Design: Ensures smooth functionality across various screen sizes and devices.
Error Handling: Displays appropriate messages for invalid inputs or failed API requests.
